# c3 - CodeCommit CLI
`c3` is a tool which provides AWS CodeCommit functionality from the command line. 

This is still in the very early stages of development 

## Usage 

- `c3 pr [checkout, create, diff list]`
- `c3 link [filepath | pr:123]`

## Installation

Currently only prebuilt binaries from [releases page][]

Building from source is also possible but the actual process still needs work.
